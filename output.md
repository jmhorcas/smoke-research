##### A B S T R A C T

Software Product Lines (SPL) are not static software artifacts, but they evolve over time. The planning,
realization, and release of a SPL requires many high-level decisions involving many different stakeholders
with different expertise. Taking their opinions into account to make the right decisions is not trivial. Currently
there are no mechanisms to assist stakeholders in the decision making process in an informed manner. In this
paper, we propose the use of belief uncertainty in conjunction with feature models to assist in the evolution of
SPLs by explicitly quantifying opinions and their associated uncertainty. We present a novel approach in which
subjective logic is used to represent the opinions of stakeholders in three evolution scenarios, namely feature
model evolution, next release problem and variability reduction. We apply our approach to the evolution of
the Xiaomi MiBand SmartWatch SPL over the time period from July 2014 to October 2023. We present an
implementation of our approach and evaluate its scalability.


The planning, realization and release of a software _product_ _line_
(SPL) centers around features (Apel et al., 2013). In fact, feature _mod-_
_els have_ become the main artifact that guides the whole SPL process (Raatikainen et al., 2019), specifying the variability of the system
as a collection of common and variable features. As a result, it is therefore not surprising that many high-level decisions about the evolution
of an SPL are made at the granularity of features (Marques et al., 2019).
For example, at some point, a decision might be needed on whether or
not to add a certain feature to the set of planned features of the SPL (aka
_evolution_ _of_ _the_ _variability Ali_ et al., 2019; Marques et al., 2019). Another
question might be to identify which features should be realized for the
coming release (aka the _next_ _release_ _problem Bagnall_ et al., 2001; Mamun
et al., 2016; Ullah et al., 2010). Or, finally, one might want to decide
on how many products to sell to end users, that is, whether to allow
end users to customize their products as much as the realization allows,
or whether to reduce the number of possible products artificially (aka
_variability_ _reduction Hentze_ et al., 2022; Sundermann et al., 2021b).

To make the right decisions, many SPL stakeholders with different
expertise might be involved. This includes obviously software developers that are experts in different domains, but also hardware experts,

financial planners, human resources, marketers, etc. Taking the opinions of that many people into account to make the right decisions
is not trivial. Conflicts often arise among stakeholders due to their
differing opinions (or beliefs) about a specific statement, making it
difficult to reach a consensus. The uncertainty associated to an opinion
cannot be neglected. Having a measure of the degree of uncertainty
associated with a resulting decision can be useful, for example, to
discard any decision whose degree of uncertainty is above a given
threshold. This cannot be achieved with standard probabilistic logic,
but it is possible with our proposal. Moreover, in an SPL, features often
have dependencies between them, and decisions about specific features
must consider those dependencies, increasing their uncertainty.

In this paper, we extend our initial ideas presented in our short SPLC
paper (Burgue√±o et al., 2023) where we proposed a novel approach that
uses belief _uncertainty (Troya_ et al., 2021) in conjunction with feature
models to explicitly quantify the opinions of stakeholders regarding the
evolution of an SPL. We outlined how subjective _logic (J√∏sang, 2016),_
a formalism for reasoning under belief uncertainty, can be used to
represent and combine the opinions of stakeholders and explained how
we envision it could be used to make decisions in the context of the next
release problem. In this paper, we extend these initial ideas as follows:

**2.** **Uncertainty** **and** **subjective** **logic**

This section introduces the main concepts of belief uncertainty and
subjective logic that we use throughout the paper.

_2.1._ _Types_ _of_ _uncertainty_

_Uncertainty (Liu, 2010)_ is defined as the state that involves imperfect and/or unknown information. It applies to predictions of future
events, estimations, physical measurements, or unknown properties of
a system. Uncertainty can be classified into two categories according to
its nature: aleatory, when it is due to probabilistic variability or randomness; and epistemic, when it is due to lack of knowledge. While aleatory
uncertainty is irreducible, epistemic uncertainty can be reduced with
additional information or knowledge.

Uncertainty can take different forms according _to_ _its_ _source._ For example, measurement _uncertainty (Joint_ Committee for Guides in Metrology, 2008) refers to the inability to know with complete precision
the value of a quantity. It can be due to different causes, such as
unreliable data sources and communication networks; tolerance in the
measurement of the values of the physical elements; estimates due
to the lack of accurate knowledge about certain parameters, or the
inability to determine whether a particular event has actually happened
or not. Belief _uncertainty (Troya_ et al., 2021) is a particular type of
_epistemic uncertainty_ where an agent is uncertain about an statement.
For instance, it can capture the inability to decide whether something
is true or not (i.e., a Boolean predicate), and, by definition, has a
subjective nature.

In Troya et al. (2021) different kinds of uncertainty were identified
and classified. The authors also analyzed how uncertainty is represented in software models and used in the context of model-based
software engineering (MBSE). In many occasions, belief uncertainty is
expressed by probabilities (interpreted in Probability theory De Finetti,
2017 or in Uncertainty theory Liu, 2010), possibilities (in Fuzzy set theory Zimmermann, 2001), plausibilities (in the Dempster‚ÄìShafer theory
of evidence Shafer, 1976) or opinions (in subjective logic J√∏sang, 2016).

_2.2._ _Belief_ _uncertainty_ _and_ _subjective_ _logic_

In this paper, our focus is on belief uncertainty, and we use subjective
_logic (J√∏sang, 2016),_ which is a type of probabilistic logic, to capture
the beliefs of stakeholders.

In subjective logic, each opinion about a statement is composed of
four values: (1) the degree of belief ùëè that the statement is true; (2) the
degree of disbelief ùëë that the statement is true (i.e., the belief that the
statement is false) ; (3) the degree of uncertainty ùë¢ about the statement
(i.e., the amount of uncommitted belief); and (4) the base _rate ùëé_ or
_prior_ _probability of_ the statement (i.e., the objective probability). The
four values are represented in an SBoolean vector (Burgue√±o et al.,


**Fig.** **1. A** subjective Boolean opinion represented using Barycentric coordinates (J√∏sang,
2016).

2022) defined as a 4-tuple (ùëè, _ùëë,_ _ùë¢,_ _ùëé),_ and satisfying ùëè + ùëë + ùë¢ = 1, and
_ùëè,_ _ùëë,_ _ùë¢,_ _ùëé_ ‚àà [0, 1].

Intuitively, the base _rate of_ an opinion represents the objective probability that can be assigned to the statement using a _priori evidences_ or
statistical estimates, whilst the other elements of the tuple represent
the subjective degrees of belief, disbelief, and uncertainty about the
statement assigned by an agent (whom we will call stakeholder). Thus,
regardless of the value of the prior probability, different stakeholders
can express their subjective opinions about the statement, including
their degree of uncertainty.[1] With this definition, the type Boolean
can be embedded into SBoolean as follows: the Boolean value true
is represented as SBoolean (1, 0, 0, _ùë•),_ and false as SBoolean
(0, 1, 0, _ùë•),_ where the base rate can take any value ‚àà [0,1].

Opinions can be represented on an equilateral triangle using
Barycentric coordinates as shown in Fig. 1 (J√∏sang, 2016). A point
inside the triangle represents a (ùëèùë•, _ùëëùë•,_ _ùë¢ùë•) triple._ Vertices at the bottom
represent absolute opinions, and the vertex at the top represents the
vacuous opinion (ùë¢ùë• = 1). Dogmatic opinions belong to the baseline
(ùë¢ùë• = 0), and correspond to probabilities. The base rate ùëéùë•, or prior
probability, is shown along the baseline, too.

The projected _probability (or projection)_ of an opinion is defined as
_ùëÉùë•_ = ùëèùë• + ùëéùë•ùë¢ùë•. Graphically, it is formed by projecting the opinion
_ùúîùë•_ onto the base, parallel to the base rate director line. The projected
probability permits combining the objective and subjective values into
one single probability, which modifies the prior base rate according to
the opinion of the agent.

Let us illustrate the use of SBoolean with an example. Hana needs
to assign a cost to an NFC chipset. She has been provided an estimated
cost of 5K EUR. Based on the previous interactions with the company
providing the estimate, the statistics show that in 95% of the cases the
final price was accurate, and only in 5% of the cases the final price
was higher or lower. However, given the current political situation
worldwide and the fact that the price of hardware components has
increased, she does not fully trust the quote. Therefore, she expresses
her opinion on the fact that the cost will be the one provided as
#### SBoolean(0.6, 0.1, 0.3, 0.95), which means that she trusts the
original prediction (0.95) with a degree of belief of 60%, she thinks that
it might be wrong with a degree of disbelief of 10%, and she expresses
her uncertainty with a 30%.

The projected _probability_ (J√∏sang, 2016) (or projection) of an
#### SBoolean opinion is defined as ùëÉ = ùëè + ùëé √ó ùë¢, and allows us to move

1 Note that the benefits of subjective logic as opposed to Kleene
logic (Kleene, 1938) is that Kleene logic does not include base rates and
therefore probability projections cannot be derived.

from opinions expressed in subjective logic to a single value opinion,
(i.e., a probability). For example, the projection of Hana‚Äôs opinion on
the price of the NFC chipset is 0.885 (88.5%).

Subjective Logic comes with the traditional logical operators (and,
#### or, implies, etc.) (J√∏sang, 2016), which are used to combine the
opinions of the same person/agent about different statements. In previous work (Mu√±oz et al., 2020b), we implemented for the type
#### SBoolean the basic operations not, and, and or; and secondary operators implies, equivalence, and xor of the traditional Boolean
algebra by extending them to subjective logic.

Apart from the traditional logical operators, Subjective logic implements fusion operators for combining the subjective opinions of
_different people/agents_ about the same statement. The goal of these
fusion operators is to produce a single opinion that better reflects the
collection of opinions, or is closer to the truth than each opinion in
isolation. We present them in detail in the following subsection.

_2.3._ _Fusion_ _operators_

Subjective logic comes with a set of fusion _operators J√∏sang (2016),_
J√∏sang et al. (2017), Van Der Heijden et al. (2018) that can be used
to combine _opinions of_ different agents about the same statement. Each
fusion operator is designed for a specific purpose and scenario. Depending on the situation, the person in charge of merging the opinions needs
to decide which fusion operator is the most suitable for each particular
case.

In the following, we present a brief description of the fusion operators and illustrate their behavior by merging opinions ùë§ùëñ = (ùëèùëñ, _ùëëùëñ,_ _ùë¢ùëñ,_ _ùëéùëñ)._
The merged opinion will be denoted ùë§ = (ùëè, _ùëë,_ _ùë¢,_ _ùëé)._ The situations in
which they are applicable are also discussed.

 - Belief **Constraint** **Fusion** **(BCF). This** operator is used when the

stakeholders have committed their choices and will not change their
minds, even if the result is that no consensus will be reached. It
computes the overlapping beliefs (the relative Harmony) and the
non-overlapping beliefs (the relative Conflict ) of the opinions to
fuse. More precisely, in the case of two opinions ùë§ùë• and ùë§ùë¶, it
computes ùêªùëéùëü = ùëèùë•ùëèùë¶ + ùëèùë•ùë¢ùë¶ + ùëèùë¶ùë¢ùë• and ùê∂ùëúùëõ = ùëèùë•ùëëùë¶ + ùëèùë¶ùëëùë•. Then, in
the general case, the components of the fused opinion are defined
as follows:

_ùêªùëéùëü_ _ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶_ _ùëéùë•(1_ ‚àí _ùë¢ùë•)_ + ùëéùë¶(1 ‚àí _ùë¢ùë¶)_
_ùëè_ = _[ùëë]_ [=] [1] [‚àí] _[ùëè]_ [‚àí] _[ùë¢]_ [‚àí] _[ùëé,]_ _[ùë¢]_ [=] _[ùëé]_ [=]
1 ‚àí _ùê∂ùëúùëõ_ _[,]_ 1 ‚àí _ùê∂ùëúùëõ_ _[,]_ 2 ‚àí _ùë¢ùë•_ ‚àí _ùë¢ùë¶_

The divisor (1‚àíùê∂ùëúùëõ) normalizes the belief mass and uncertainty, and
ensures additivity. The constraint fusion operator is commutative
and non-idempotent. Associativity is preserved when the base rate
is equal for all agents. The result is undefined in case of totally
conflicting opinions.

 - Consensus **&** **Compromise** **Fusion** **(CCF). This** is applicable when

stakeholders (possibly non-expert) have dependent opinions about
the same fact (e.g., in a survey). It preserves shared beliefs and
transforms conflicting opinions into vague beliefs. It is suitable for
situations in which consensus is sought if it exists, and a vague
opinion is acceptable in case of diverging opinions. This operator
assumes dependence between opinions[2] and it is idempotent with the
vacuous opinion as neutral element. It uses a three-steps process:
(1) consensus; (2) compromise; (3) merge. The consensus step determines the shared beliefs and disbeliefs between the two opinions.
The compromise step redistributes conflicting residual beliefs and
disbeliefs to produce the so-called compromise belief. Finally, the

2 Opinions are said to be dependent when they are based on the same or
dependent evidence; and they are said to be independent when they are based
on different or independent evidence.

 - Aleatory **Cumulative** **Belief** **Fusion** **(ACBF). This** operator is ap
plied when the evidences are independent, that is, the amount of
evidence increases when more stakeholders give their opinion. This
operator is suitable when giving opinions about a variable governed
by a frequentist process, such as flipping a coin. Like the ABF, the
ACBF operator calculates the mean of the opinions by weighting the
belief of each opinion with the product of the uncertainty of the others. However, it modulates this mean by subtracting the product of
the uncertainties. Thus, in the case of three non-dogmatic opinions,
their aleatory cumulative fusion can be expressed as follows:

_ùëèùë•ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß_ + ùëèùë¶ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùëß + ùëèùëßùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶
_ùëè_ = _,_ _ùëë_ = 1 ‚àí _ùëè_ ‚àí _ùë¢_ ‚àí _ùëé_
_ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶_ + ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùëß + ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß ‚àí 2ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß

_ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß_ _ùëéùë•_ + ùëéùë¶ + ùëéùëß
_ùë¢_ = _,_ _ùëé_ =
_ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶_ + ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùëß + ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß ‚àí 2ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß 3

Again, if dogmatic opinions are present, this operator computes the
cumulative fusion of these opinions only, resulting in a dogmatic
opinion too (J√∏sang et al., 2017).

3 Due to the length of the algorithm that computes this operator we do not
present it here but refer the reader to J√∏sang (2016) (chapter 12).


merge step distributes that compromise between the shared belief
and the uncertainty to compute the resulting opinion.[3] This operator
is applicable in situations where (possibly non-expert) agents have
dependent opinions about the same fact, such as when they are
asked to give their opinions in a survey (J√∏sang, 2016).

- Averaging **Belief** **Fusion** **(ABF).**

This operator assumes that the agents‚Äô opinions are dependent. It is
commutative, idempotent, and non-associative, and does not have a
neutral element, i.e., every opinion, even a vacuous one, influences
the fused result. This situation applies when all agents observe the
same situation at the same time, and all opinions should be taken
into account, for example, when a jury tries to reach a verdict after
having observed the court proceedings.
Basically, this operator computes the average of the opinions by
weighing the belief of each opinion with the product of the uncertainty of the rest. In the case of three non-dogmatic opinions ùë§ùë•, ùë§ùë¶
and ùë§ùëß, it is expressed as follows:

_ùëèùë•ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß_ + ùëèùë¶ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùëß + ùëèùëßùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶
_ùëè_ = _,_ _ùëë_ = 1 ‚àí _ùëè_ ‚àí _ùë¢_ ‚àí _ùëé_

_ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶_ + ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùëß + ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß


3ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß _ùëéùë•_ + ùëéùë¶ + ùëéùëß
_ùë¢_ = _,_ _ùëé_ =
_ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùë¶_ + ùë¢ùë•ùë¢ùëß + ùë¢ùë¶ùë¢ùëß 3

If dogmatic opinions are present, this operator computes the average
of the beliefs and disbeliefs of these opinions only, resulting in a
dogmatic opinion too (J√∏sang et al., 2017).

- Weighted **Belief** **Fusion** **(WBF). This** operator is similar to the

ABF operator, but gives more weight to those opinions with less
uncertainty i.e., the smaller the value of the uncertainty mass, the
higher the weight‚Äîunlike ABF where all opinions have the same
weight even when some of them are very uncertain. This operator
has the vacuous opinion as neutral element and, like ABF, it is
_idempotent._
To illustrate how WBF works, the following expression computes
the WBF of three non-dogmatic opinions ùë§ùë•, ùë§ùë¶ and ùë§ùëß (van der
Heijden et al., 2018):

 - Epistemic **Cumulative** **Belief** **Fusion** **(ECBF). This** extends the

ACBF operator . First, it calculates ACBF and then applies uncertainty maximization to the result. The uncertainty-maximized opinion ¬®w of an opinion ùë§ is the opinion with maximum uncertainty that
still preserves the same projected probability as ùë§ (J√∏sang, 2016).
Unlike ACBF, the ECBF is used for facts whose uncertainty is of
epistemic nature.

More details on which fusion operator can be applied in each
situation are introduced in Section 4. The interested reader can consult
the formal definitions of the operators in J√∏sang (2016) with some
extensions in J√∏sang et al. (2017), Van Der Heijden et al. (2018).

Since different opinions can be fused in various ways depending on how the fusion situation needs to be handled, we identified
in Burgue√±o et al. (2022) the following characteristics that can be
helpful to determine which operator to use in a specific case.

  - Willingness to compromise. There is room for compromise even

in case of totally conflicting opinions.

  - Dependence between opinions. The opinions were formed wit
nessing the same events at the same time.

  - Vacuous opinion as neutral element (idempotence). Fusion of

vacuous opinions (i.e., those with uncertainty mass ùë¢ùë• = 1) have
no effect in the result.

  - Preserve shared beliefs, and conflicting opinions are turned into

vague belief. In order to find a compromise, it is possible to turn
conflicting opinions into vague beliefs.

Table 1 maps the fusion operators to these characteristics.

**3.** **Decision** **making** **in** **SPL** **development**

During the development of an SPL, there will be a moment in
time where there is a variability model of the current state of the SPL
_ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_, i.e., a model that contains all the features that have already
been realized. In the case where marketing or other reasons warrant
that not all possible products of the SPL are made available to end
users in a release, there might also be a variability model ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë_
that encodes the (artificially) reduced configuration variability for end
users. Most likely there is also a variability model of the planned
features of the SPL for future releases, which we call ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ . It holds
that ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë_ _‚äÜ_ _ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_ _‚äÜ_ _ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ .

Fig. 2 depicts the evolution of those three variability models over
time. The feature planning (ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ ), the feature realization
(ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_ ), and the feature release (ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë_ ) of the SPL can evolve
at different speeds, and moving from one variability model to the next
requires decisions to be made.

_3.1._ _Evolution_ _scenarios_ _for_ _feature_ _models_

We identified three different kinds of evolution scenarios for the
variability models that require collaborative decision-making among
stakeholders (highlighted with blue arrows in Fig. 2)[4]:

4 In the following, we use the second subscript (ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë° or ùëõùëíùë•ùë°) in the
feature model names ùêπ _ùëÄ_ to refer to the current or the next feature model
in the evolution scenarios.

_ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë,ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë°_ ‚Üí _ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë,ùëõùëíùë•ùë°_

Scenario 1 consists of using the current planned feature model
(ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë,ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë°)_ as a basis, and suggesting edits (Th√ºm et al.,
2009) such as adding new features, including new relationships or
updating existing ones, adding cross-tree constraints (if necessary),
and potentially even removing planned features that have not been
realized yet. As result, we obtain the next planned feature model
(ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë,ùëõùëíùë•ùë°)._

2. Next **Release** **Problem (Bagnall** et al., 2001; Mamun et al., 2016;

Ullah et al., 2010): Which features should be implemented next?

_ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë°_ ‚Üí _ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùëõùëíùë•ùë°_

Scenario 2 consists in choosing which planned features that have not
been realized yet in the current realized feature model
(ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë°)_ (i.e., features that are part of ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ and are
not part of ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_ ) should the development team work on next,
obtanining as result the next realized feature model (ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùëõùëíùë•ùë°)._
3. Variability **Reduction (Hentze** et al., 2022; Sundermann et al.,

2021b): How can the configuration space of the current realized SPL
be reduced to a reasonable number of possible configurations for the
current release?

_ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë°_ ‚Üí _ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë,ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë°_

Scenario 3 consists in choosing which edits to apply to the current
realized feature model (ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë°)_ to reduce the variability
(e.g., making an optional feature mandatory or deciding which
additional cross-tree constraints to add), obtaining as result a reduced feature model (ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë,ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë°)._ Reducing the variability of
a SPL simplifies maintainability and quality assurance (Bagheri and
Gasevic, 2011), as fewer products need to be considered.

The decision making for these three scenarios is non-trivial, as different stakeholders have different views on the SPL features depending
on the scenario. For example, when deciding on what features to realize
next (Scenario 2), opinions of different stakeholders could range from
‚Äò‚ÄòMarketing: in high demand by end users‚Äô‚Äô, to ‚Äò‚ÄòDistribution expert:
high maintenance cost‚Äô‚Äô, to ‚Äò‚ÄòDeveloper: unclear how to implement
efficiently‚Äô‚Äô.

_3.2._ _Xiaomi_ _Mi_ _Band_ _SPL_ _example_

The Xiaomi Mi Band is a wearable activity tracker that resembles
a bracelet and can be worn on either wrist. The first version of the
Mi Band was released in July 2014, followed by the Mi Band 1S in
November 2015. There have been 17 models released so far, with the
latest two being the Mi Band 8 and Mi Band 8 NFC in October 2023.

From the very beginning, Mi Band offered multiple features to
users, e.g., a FitnessMonitor or SleepTracker. Since all Mi
Band models provide these features, they are marked as mandatory.
The Mi Band 1S added an additional feature, the HeartRateSensor,
which therefore shows up as the first optional feature. As the SPL
evolves, some features are also mutually exclusive. For example, over
time, Xiaomi has evolved the Mi Band‚Äôs support for the Bluetooth
Communication Protocol from Bluetooth 4.0 to Bluetooth Low Energy


-----

**Fig.** **2. SPL** evolution scenarios for variability models.

**Fig.** **3. Mi** Band 1S evolution example.


BLEv4.0, BLEv4.2, BLEv5.0, BLEv5.1 and BLEv5.2. Because each model
comes with only one Bluetooth implementation, the corresponding
features in the feature model are in an xor relationship as shown
in the feature model for Mi Band 2. At times there are also functional dependencies between features. For example, starting with Mi
Band 3, ContactlessPayment is offered as an optional feature,
but in order to support it, NFC must also be present. These feature
dependencies are specified in the model with the cross-tree constraint
e.g., ContactlessPayment ‚áí NFC.

Fig. 3 shows an example of the Xiaomi _Mi_ _Band_ _SPL that_ we use in
the following to illustrate our three scenarios. The whole SPL of the
_Xiaomi_ _Mi_ _Band is_ presented in Section 5.

Let us imagine we are in November 2015 when Mi Band 1S was just
released. The feature model of the Mi Band product line at that point is
represented using white features in Fig. 3. Note that there is only one
optional feature, the HeartRateSensor (HRS), and therefore only
two possible products (the Mi Band 1 and the Mi Band 1S). This feature
model represents ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë_ as well, i.e., all the white features have
been implemented, and they are part of at least one of the two products.
Both the white and gray features in Fig. 3 represent ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ . In other
words, in November 2015, the features highlighted in gray represent
the set of features that have not been realized yet, but that are very
likely going to be part of a future Mi Band product.

**Feature** **Model** **Evolution:** According to our three evolution scenarios, the Mi Band SPL can first evolve by adding new features to
_ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ for the future releases of the smartwatch or by removing
features that stakeholders think should never be realized. For instance,


the marketing team could propose that maybe in a long-term future
it would make sense to incorporate a new gyroscope sensor into the
SPL in order to improve step counting (see blue Gyroscope feature
in Fig. 3).

**Next** **Release** **Problem:** In the second scenario, the stakeholders
need to make decisions about what features to implement and include
in the next release (i.e., features to be included in the ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_ for Mi
Band 2). Here decisions may involve deciding the incorporation of an
independent feature (e.g., MovementFilter), deciding on a feature
with dependencies on other features (e.g., to incorporate the Con#### tactlessPayment feature, the NFC feature must be implemented
too), or deciding on a group of related features, such as, a variation
point and its variants (e.g., the development of the Screen feature
and its variants).

**Variability** **Reduction:** Finally, the third scenario is illustrated in
the Mi Band SPL when the number of possible products of ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_ is
too high and it does not make sense to have that many versions of the
smartwatch on the market. In this case, it needs to be decided which
specific products can be omitted from being released by reducing the
variability.

**4.** **Belief** **uncertainty** **applied** **to** **SPL**

In this section, we illustrate our decision-making approach based
on subjective logic using the three evolution scenarios presented above
using the Mi Band SPL in three separate sections. Finally, we define
Likert-type scales to ease the definition of opinions for non-expert
stakeholders.


-----

_4.1._ _Scenario_ _1:_ _Feature_ _model_ _evolution_

Fig. 3 shows the plans for the Mi Band SPL (ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ ) as they could
have been in November 2015 when Mi Band 1S had just been released.
As explained before, the features shown in white are already realized
(i.e., from Mi Band 1 and 1S), whereas the gray features represent those
features that are currently being considered for the near future (which
we took from Mi Band 2 and 3, and even some of Mi Band 4). This
feature model is intentionally not set in stone, but continuously evolves
to keep up with technological developments and market trends. For
instance, the marketing team could propose that in a long-term future
it would make sense to incorporate a new gyroscope sensor into the
SPL in order to improve step counting (see blue Gyroscope feature
in Fig. 3).

_4.1.1._ _Deciding_ _on_ _an_ _independent_ _feature_

To decide whether the Gyroscope feature should be included
in the set of planned features, representatives from the marketing,
hardware, and software departments sit together and provide their
opinions on the feature.

The marketing stakeholder Bob thinks that Gyroscope, which
improves the precision of the FitnessMonitor and in particular step
counting, is an interesting feature for physically active customers. It
should increase the number of units sold according to a market study
performed. This study was a poll sent to customers who have bought
previous versions of the watch, so the results are not representative of
the general population. Therefore, his opinion carries uncertainty and
can be represented by the SBoolean(0.9, 0.0, 0.1, 0.5). That
is, Bob has a belief of 0.9 on the fact that the Gyroscope should be
included, a disbelief of 0, and an uncertainty of 0.1. Note that the base
rate is 0.5 because the a priori probability that a feature is included is
50% as there are only two options: it is included, or it is not included.

On the other hand, Alice, the representative of the hardware department, does not recommend the realization of the Gyroscope feature
because it will have a considerable impact on power consumption. She
knows that there is new hardware in development that also improves
step counting precision and would affect the battery less. However,
whether or not that technology will be available in time is uncertain.
She gives her opinion on the Gyroscope feature as SBoolean(0.1,
#### 0.7, 0.2, 0.5).

Finally, the software department representative Taylor thinks that
from their department‚Äôs point of view, it should not be too difficult to
support the Gyroscope feature. Hence, it could make sense to add it
to ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ to investigate the feature‚Äôs software requirements further.
Their opinion therefore is SBoolean(0.4, 0.05, 0.55, 0.5).

To be able to use our approach to help make a decision, we need
to fuse these three opinions, hence we need to choose the appropriate
fusion operator. We are facing a case of epistemic uncertainty (vs.
aleatory uncertainty). Since we have one person from each department
giving their opinions based on their independent experiences and backgrounds, we can assume that there are no _dependencies_ _among_ _these_
_opinions._ Therefore, the fusion operator that applies in this situation is
_Epistemic_ _Cumulative_ _Belief_ _Fusion (ECBF)._ The result of fusing the three
opinions using the ECBF operator is: SBoolean(0.45, 0.0, 0.55,
#### 0.5). The three stakeholders decide that a feature will be included
in the plan only when the projection of the fused opinion (i.e., the
probability) is higher than 0.6. A lower threshold value would imply a
low confidence and hence a high risk of wasting time investigating the
planned feature, which they are not willing to take. The projection of
the fused opinion in this case is 0.72. Therefore, the three stakeholders
decide that the Gyroscope feature should be added to ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ .


_4.2._ _Scenario_ _2:_ _Next_ _release_ _problem_

In the second scenario, the stakeholders need to make decisions
about what features to implement and include in the next release
(i.e., which gray features in Fig. 3 to be included in ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_ for
Mi Band 2). Here decisions may involve: (i) deciding the realization
of an independent feature (e.g., MovementFilter), (ii) deciding on
a feature with dependencies on other features (e.g., to incorporate
the ContactlessPayment feature, the NFC feature must be implemented too), or (iii) deciding on a group of related features, such as a
variation point and its variants (e.g., the development of the Screen
feature and its variants).

From a decision-making process point of view, when deciding
on an independent feature for the next release problem, we face
the same case as presented in Section 4.1.1. For instance, a rather
straightforward decision is to determine whether MovementFilter
should be realized or not. Here again, we can imagine that stakeholders from marketing, hardware, and software provide their opinions,
e.g. SBoolean(0.7, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5), SBoolean(0.3, 0.5,
#### 0.2, 0.5), and SBoolean(0.7, 0.0, 0.3, 0.5). Again, we
are facing a case of epistemic uncertainty, and the Epistemic _Cu-_
_mulative_ _Belief_ _Fusion (ECBF)_ fusion operator is applied, resulting in
#### SBoolean(0.38, 0.0, 0.62, 0.5) with a projection of 0.69.

The two remaining cases (ii) and (iii) are not so straightforward,
hence we present them in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, respectively. Furthermore, it could be the case that the stakeholders do not only want to
decide on the individual realization or not of (groups of) features, but
need rank all the possible options to determine which ones to realize
based on the available development resources. We present this case in
Section 4.2.3.

_4.2.1._ _Deciding_ _on_ _a_ _feature_ _with_ _cross-tree_ _constraints_

Xiaomi has suggested studying the viability of realizing contactless
payment, but as Fig. 3 shows, the realization of the feature Con#### tactlessPayment (CP) requires the realization of the feature NFC.[5]

Instead of making an authoritarian decision, the manager of the department asks a group of three engineers for their opinions. The SBooleans
that represent the engineers‚Äô opinions on these two features are presented in Table 2.

To take into account the requires dependency, we need to aggregate
the individual feature opinions using the logical and operator (‚àß). Only
then we can combine the resulting opinions with the appropriate fusion
operator. Therefore, the fused opinion is calculated using the following
formula:

We are again facing a case of epistemic uncertainty. However, since
the manager is asking for the opinion of three engineers that work in
the same department, they all have more or less the same background
and knowledge about the company and the team (i.e., in terms of
subjective logic, they are observing the same fact), hence their opinions
are considered dependent. There are three fusion operators that apply to
this case: Average Belief Fusion (ABF), Weighed Belief Fusion (WBF),
and Consensus and Compromise Fusion (CCF). The first one should be
applied when every opinion carries the same weight (i.e., when one
wants to give the same credibility to each person), the second should
be applied when one wants to give more credibility to those people

5 For space reasons, we use abbreviations (see underlined letters in Fig. 3
instead of the long feature names for the Mi Band SPL.

Opinions of the three engineers on each feature.

CP (0.5, 0.1, 0.4, 0.5) (0.9, 0.03, 0.07, 0.5) (0.8, 0.15, 0.05, 0.5)
NFC (0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5) (0.75, 0.2, 0.05, 0.5) (0.94, 0.03, 0.03, 0.5)

WeightedBeliefFusion (0.724, 0.203, 0.073, 0.25) 0.742006
ConsensusAndCompromiseFusion (0.524, 0.190, 0.286, 0.25) 0.595724


with stronger opinions (i.e., with less uncertainty), and the third one
should be used when the desired behavior is that in the presence of
divergent opinions, the level of uncertainty in the resulting opinion
is increased. While the operator CCF provides a more conservative
opinion, the operators ABF and WBF are more ‚Äò‚Äòrisky‚Äô‚Äô. Table 3 presents
the fused opinions for all three operators.

After checking the results, the manager observes that, even in the
more conservative case, the engineers support the inclusion of Con#### tactlessPayment with almost 60% of confidence, hence he decides
to suggest the implementation of both features.

_4.2.2._ _Dealing_ _with_ _feature_ _relationships_ _and_ _complex_ _constraints_

Our approach can also handle more complex decisions involving
multiple features. Each stakeholder has to express an independent
opinion on each feature involved in the decision, and then we apply
the boolean formula that corresponds to the feature relationships and
constraints between the features specified in the feature model. As such,
we can deal with feature model parent‚Äìchild constraints (mandatory,
_optional, or, xor),_ the standard cross-tree constraints (requires and
_excludes),_ as well as any other more complex constraints that can be
mapped to a boolean formula that uses the boolean operators and, or,
and not.

For instance, in the Mi Band SPL, the move to Mi Band 2 required a
more complex decision to be made. Mi Band 1 and 1S did not have
a screen. For the next meeting with its main shareholders, Xiaomi
needs to determine whether the Screen feature and its variants should
be implemented or not for Mi Band 2. We can observe in Fig. 3
that there are different options: the screen type could be AMOLED,
which has capacitive sensing, or OLED, which is a lot cheaper but
needs a CapacitiveButton for capturing input. With an AMOLED
screen, it would even potentially be possible to go for a full-fledged
#### Touchscreen.

Once everyone gives their opinion on each feature of the tree,
the individual opinion of that person on the fact that one way or
another Screen is included in the next realization is calculated with
the following formula:

The formula is a disjunction of all possible configurations of the
subtree. Since the Screen is the parent of an xor group it cannot
be realized on its own. Furthermore, the realization of a child feature
always depends on the realization of the parent.

The different departments collect and aggregate the opinions of
their members as described in Section 4.2.1. In summary, the general
opinion of the marketing department states that it is important to
implement Screen, but they do not have an opinion on whether
it should be OLED or AMOLED. On the other hand, the hardware
department prefers OLED because it is cheaper, while the software team
has a slight preference for AMOLED and, if the decision is to go for
#### AMOLED, they are against the TS, mainly because the team is currently


operating at full capacity and they do not have the resources to do
additional work. Table 4 presents these opinions.

After applying the formula above and fusing the opinions with the
CBF operator, the resulting opinion is SBoolean(0.733, 0.000,
#### 0.267, 0.508) with projection 0.87. Based on this result, it is
decided that Screen will be presented to the shareholders.

The next step is to decide on the technical level how exactly the
#### Screen is going to be implemented. For this, each possible branch
of the tree needs to be explored. Table 5 presents the opinions of each
department for each branch, as well as the fused opinions for the branch
using the CFB fusion operator and its projection.

Based on these results, the features Screen and OLED are clearly
the most likely ones to be realized, but AMOLED and TouchScreen
could also be considered.

_4.2.3._ _Determining_ _feature_ _priorities_

It is one thing to determine whether a feature should be realized or
not, but in the end what needs to be decided is the _set_ _of_ _features that_
should be realized for the next release, taking into account the available
development resources. To this aim, we suggest ranking the features
based on the projection value of the fused opinions. The resulting list
can then be used to prioritize _feature_ _realizations._

For example, in our Mi Band SPL, if we use the previously calculated
opinions for the features MF, NFC, CP, Scr, OLED, AMOLED and TS,
and add to that the fused opinions for BLE SBoolean(0.95, 0.0, 0.05,
0.5), BLE4.0 SBoolean(0.9, 0.0, 0.1, 0.5) and BLE4.2 SBoolean(0.85,
0.0, 0.15, 0.5), then the resulting prioritized feature list for the next
release is:

1. 0.975: BLE
2. 0.972: Scr
3. 0.926: BLE and BLE4.0
4. 0.914: Scr and OLED (and hence also CB)
5. 0.902: BLE and BLE4.2
6. 0.900: MF
7. 0.762: NFC
8. 0.746: Scr and AMOLED
9. 0.600: Scr and AMOLED and TS
10. 0.589: CP (knowing that NFC is already realized)

With this information, and information on how much resources are
needed to realize each feature and how many resources are available,
the decision on which features to implement for the next release can
be made. In our example, given the development constraints and the
fact that there is a clear gap between the projected probabilities of MF
and NFC, Xiaomi decided to realize the top 6 features for Mi Band 2.

_4.3._ _Scenario_ _3:_ _Variability_ _reduction_

Assuming we are approaching June 2016 and the development of
the 6 new features (BLE, Scr, BLE4.0, BLE4.2, OLED (and hence
also CB), and MF) are well underway. With those features, and the
optional feature HRS from Mi Band 1S, ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_ of the Mi Band SPL
(white and gray features of Fig. 3) now has technically 24 different

configurations. It does not make sense to have that many versions of
Mi Band on the market, and hence the variability of the SPL needs to
be reduced to a more manageable size.

Again, subjective logic can help with the required decision making.
We suggest that in this case, one needs to gather the opinions of
the relevant stakeholders on the different possible _products._ Two of
the 24 possible products correspond to Mi Band 1 and Mi Band 1S,
i.e., they have already been released, which leaves 22 new possible
configurations to consider. For instance, one could imagine running
market surveys to gather the opinions of different stakeholder groups
on specific products, and then combine the opinions using the appropriate fusion operator. In the end, the products are ranked according to
their projection, and depending on how many different configurations
the company is willing to support, the top ùë• products are released.

For example, for determining the variability reduction for the Mi
Band 2 release, a market study could have resulted in the following
ranked list of products:

In the end, for the Mi Band 2, the top 3 products of this list were
released in June 2016. All new products featured a Screen, and none
of the new products used the outdated Bluetooth BT4.0. The Chinese
_Edition was_ released with HRS and BLE4.0, the International _Edition_
also had HRS but with BLE4.2, and the Indian _Edition did_ not have
#### HRS, but MF instead, with BLE4.0. This variability reduction was
achieved by adding the constraints BT4.0 ‚áî ¬¨Screen, BLE ‚áí HRS


‚à® MF, and MF ‚áí ¬¨HRS ‚àß BLE4.0. These constraints, resulting in a
new ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë_ shown in the third feature model of Fig. 6, reduced the
variability significantly, bringing the total number of products to be
maintained to a more manageable number of 5.

_4.4._ _Likert-type_ _scales_ _to_ _represent_ _opinions_

Expressing an opinion as an SBoolean can be daunting, especially
for non-experts when conducting market surveys. In those contexts,
Likert scales have shown to be very effective. As part of this work,
we therefore also propose two Likert-type scales, where textual, easyto-understand literals are mapped to corresponding subjective logic
values.

Initially, a stakeholder has to determine whether their opinion
carries uncertainty or not. If not, then they should express their opinion
using the following ‚Äò‚ÄòConfident‚Äô‚Äô five-point Likert scale, which defines:
_Certain, In_ _Favor, Neutral, Against and Impossible._

Table 6 shows the 5-point scale textual literals and some possible
#### SBoolean values (carrying no uncertainty) and projections.

On the other hand, if the stakeholder feels somehow unsure about
their opinion, they should express their opinion using the following
‚Äò‚ÄòHesitant‚Äô‚Äô seven-point Likert scale, which defines: Certain, Probable,
_Possible, Uncertain, Improbable, Unlikely and Impossible. Tables_ 7 and
8 show two possible ways of mapping the 7-point scale literals to
corresponding SBoolean values with different degrees of uncertainty.
While the projections of the values are very similar, the opinions in
Table 7 carry more uncertainty than those in Table 8. The two cases are
graphically illustrated using Barycentric coordinates in Fig. 4. It would
be the job of an expert to decide on which mapping to use depending
on the situation.

Note that we have created these literals with a base rate of 0.5
to represent a binary domain, i.e., a case in which the agents give
their subjective opinion about a fact that can take two values that are
equiprobable. Different situations would require the base rate to be
adapted accordingly.

**5.** **Proof** **of** **concept** **and** **validation**

In this section, we present an implementation of our approach as a
proof of concept and evaluate its applicability and scalability by using
a real-world industrial example with 27 feature models representing
the current nine versions of the Smartwatch SPL of Xiaomi Mi Band.
The artifacts, including the feature models and information on how to
replicate the results, are available online.[6] In this section, we seek to
answer the following research questions (RQs):

- RQ1: How _feasible_ _and_ _applicable_ _is_ _the_ _proposed_ _approach_ _in_ _prac-_

_tice?_
**Rationale: The** objective is to analyze the viability and applicability of the approach in practice. We first provide an
implementation of the three evolution scenarios using open source
technologies. Then we analyze and synthesize an industrial SPL
and its evolution between July 2014 and October 2023 consisting
of 27 feature models corresponding to the nine versions of the
Xiaomi Mi Band. Finally, we apply our implementation to the
complete Xiaomi SPL.

- RQ2: Does _the_ _approach_ _scale_ _to_ _SPLs_ _of_ _realistic_ _size?_

**Rationale: Scalability** is a well-known challenge in the context of
SPLs, as already the presence of a relatively small number of features can lead to a combinatorial explosion of possible products.
It is therefore imperative for SPL approaches to demonstrate that


they do not suffer severe performance degradation when applied
to SPLs of realistic size.

_5.1._ _Open-source_ _implementation_

Fig. 5 presents an overview of the implementation of our approach
in Python. We rely on Flama,[7] a Python framework for the automated
analysis of feature models (Galindo et al., 2023), and on a Python
library of Uncertainty _Datatypes[8]_ that provides support to work with

[7 Flama: https://flamapy.github.io/.](https://flamapy.github.io/)

#### SBoolean values to express opinions and fusion operators (Bertoa
et al., 2020; Fern√°ndez-Candel et al., 2024; Mu√±oz et al., 2020a).

Our implementation includes three scripts to support the three
evolution scenarios presented throughout the paper:

  - Scenario **1:** **Feature** **Model** **Evolution.** The script takes the

stakeholder‚Äôs opinions about features to be included or removed
in ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ of the SPL, and returns the fused opinions of the
stakeholders for each feature along with its projection and the
decision to be made according to a given threshold.

  - Scenario **2:** **Next** **Release** **Problem.** It takes a feature model

and the stakeholder‚Äôs opinions about features to be implemented
for the next release, and returns fused opinions for each feature
taking into account the related/dependent features. The script
groups the features according to their dependencies. First, it
shows the feature with cross-tree constraints, then the group of
related features in the tree, and then the independent features.
Finally, it shows a ranking of the features prioritization to be
implemented according to the opinions.

  - Scenario **3:** **Variability** **Reduction.** It takes a feature model,

generates a sample of products of a given size, and determines


those products that should be realized in the following release of
the SPL according to the fused opinions of the stakeholders. The
script outputs a list of products ordered by the projection of the
fused opinions of the stakeholders (i.e., a ranking of products).
For each product, only the variable features of the products are
shown for easy inspection.

The feature models are encoded in the Universal Variability Language (UVL) (Sundermann et al., 2021a) format that is currently
riding high in the SPL community thanks to the MODEVAR initiative (Benavides et al., 2019). The stakeholder‚Äôs opinions are given in
a .csv file, and for each feature the opinions can be specified as an
#### SBoolean vector (e.g., (0.67, 0.00, 0.33, 0.50)), or as literal
(e.g., PROBABLE) as defined in Section 4.4. In addition, the fusion
operator to use when fusing the opinions can be specified, too.

_5.2._ _The_ _smartwatch_ _SPL_ _of_ _Xiaomi_ _Mi_ _Band_

We have analyzed and synthesized a real-world industry example
of an SPL: the SPL of Xiaomi for its Mi Band smartwatch. We have
chosen this SPL because despite none of the authors are affiliated

with Xiaomi and considering the inability to contact or obtain the
necessary information from any of its employees, the required SPL
information regarding the different features available in each product
version as well as the possible constraints between the features are
publicly available in the company‚Äôs official documentation and the
associated websites.[9] Thus, the features of the Mi Band and the products
that were released, are real and have been extracted from the publicly
available specifications released by Xiaomi. However, the stakeholders involved in the decision making and their opinions used in the
evolution scenarios are made up.

We have analyzed the evolution of the current nine versions of Mi
Band (1, 1s, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), and synthesized the variability,
resulting in a total of 27 feature models. Concretely, there are three
feature models for each version of Mi Band: ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_, ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_,
and ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë_ . Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate the evolution of the feature
models. Each feature model represents the ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë_ of version ùëã,
where ùëã ‚àà {1, 1ùë†, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, 8}. ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_ of version ùëã is the same feature
model, but only with the constraints imposed by the domain (marked
in bold), i.e., without those constraints imposed by the reduction of
the variability. Finally, the constraints added explicitly for variability
reduction are marked with a green +).

_5.3._ _Experimentation_ _setup_

_Scenario_ _setup. To_ analyze the scalability of our approach, we focus
on scenario 3, which is the most challenging one regarding scalability.
This is because scenario 3 generates the list of new products introduced in ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë_ compared to the previous version, and it requires
stakeholders to give their opinions about those products in order to
rank them and decide which ones are released in the market. For the
evolution of the different versions in the Xiaomi SPL we therefore need
to distinguish between ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê∑ùê∂_ (the feature model that contains
only domain constraints), and ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê¥ùê∂_ (the feature model that
contains also the constraints introduced by the variability reduction
of the previous release). The products from the latter comprise the
new products only, and hence are those to be ranked. We use 3
stakeholder opinions as votes to be considered for each product in all
cases. The SBoolean values of those opinions were artificially created
by the authors, since the specific values do not affect the scalability
experimentation.

_Parameter_ _settings. We_ perform 30 runs and calculate the medians,
means, and standard deviations for the execution time of generating
all products of ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê∑ùê∂_, and for the generation and ranking of the
products (based on the stakeholder‚Äôs opinions) of ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê¥ùê∂_ . Table 9
reports the medians. To generate all products we rely on the products

operation available in Flama, and concretely, in the implementation
based on the Glucose3 SAT solver (Audemard and Simon, 2018) of the
_PySAT library_ (Ignatiev et al., 2018).

_Execution_ _setup. The_ experiments were performed on a desktop computer with Intel Core i7-4770 CPU @ 3.4 GHz, 16 GB RAM, Windows
11, and Python 3.10.

_5.4._ _Results_ _and_ _discussion_

Table 9 shows the evolution of the Xiaomi SPL for the nine existing
versions of the Mi Band smartwatch. Since we do not have insight
into the strategic planning of the company, we cannot know ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_,
i.e., we are unaware of features that Xiaomi might have planned at
some point, but never realized in any product. The table therefore only
lists in the first column ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê∑ùê∂_ (with only domain constraints),
in the second column ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê¥ùê∂_ (including also the constraints
introduced by the variability reduction of the previous release) and
in the last column ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë_ . ùêπ _ùëÄùëùùëôùëéùëõùëõùëíùëë_ would be at least as big as
_ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê∑ùê∂_, but would include other considered features.

First, we can observe how the SPL has evolved from 12 features in
the first version (Mi Band 1) to 37 features in the most recent version
(Mi Band 8). In general, only one to three new features are added
from one version to the next (see #F), except for the evolution from
#### Mi Band 1S to Mi Band 2 where eight new features were added, and
from Mi Band 3 to Mi Band 4 with seven new features. Note also
that there is only one cross-tree constraint imposed by the domain in
_ùêπ_ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê∑ùê∂_ (see #DC constraints), namely ContactlessPayment
‚Üí NFC, originally added in Mi Band 3 (Fig. 6).

The evolution of ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê∑ùê∂_ represents a set of products ranging
from 1 to 24,192 products. Despite the fact that the analysis of all
these products by generating them from the feature model only takes
2.8 s for the largest ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê∑ùê∂_ (column ùëáùëîùëíùëõ), the realization of all
these products in the real world is not viable. To decide which new
products are released on the market, stakeholders only need to give
their opinions about the new _features involved_ in each new version,
and make decisions about the new possible realized products (#ùëÉùë£ùëúùë°ùëíùëë
of ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê¥ùê∂_, which is determined by #ùëÉùëéùëôùëô - #ùëÉùëüùëíùëô of the previous
release). The generation and ranking of these products do not pose a
scalability issue (see ùëáùëîùëíùëõ and ùëáùëüùëéùëõùëò), as the number of realized products
is very restricted by the additional constraints added. For instance, of
the 24,192 possible products from ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê∑ùê∂_ in Mi Band 8, the
stakeholders only need to decide among 6 products from ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëéùëôùëñùëßùëíùëë,ùê¥ùê∂_ .
Generating the possible 21 products and ranking the 6 new ones only
takes four respectively two milliseconds.

The biggest sets of products that had to be voted on were during the
variability reduction for Mi Band 4, where 65 new possible products
had to be ranked, and for Mi Band 5, which introduced 55 new possible products. Providing votes for that many products can be tedious for

**Fig.** **6. Evolution** of the smartwatch SPL of Xiaomi Mi Band (versions 1‚Äì5).


stakeholders, even when using literals for voting. In this case, one could
use the already provided feature opinions (when voting on the next
features to realize in scenario 2) to determine a reasonably sized subset
of the possible products that will be used for voting during variability
reduction (scenario 3). The reasoning behind this sampling heuristic is
that the products containing the features that were the most popular
ones to be realized are also most likely going to be the most popular
products.

The final number of products released ranges from 1 to 17 different
smartwatches (see #P of ùêπ _ùëÄùëüùëíùëëùë¢ùëêùëíùëë_ ), and Xiaomi usually released only
two new products for each new version (a Chinese version with the NFC
feature and an international version without NFC), with the exception
of Mi Band 2, where a specific version for India was released.


_5.5._ _Answers_ _to_ _research_ _questions_

**_RQ1:_** **_How_** **_feasible_** **_and_** **_applicable_** **_is_** **_the_** **_proposed_** **_approach_** **_in_**
**_practice?_**

We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by implementing tool support for all the evolution scenarios using open source
technologies. The applicability of our proposed approach is determined
by how well it manages the complexity of realistic SPLs in terms of total
number of features and number of evolving features between releases.

In our approach stakeholders only need to provide their opinions
on features that evolve between releases (e.g., new features, deprecated
features, changing features) and do not need to take into account the
entire feature set of the SPL. Our algorithms that take into account
opinions and feature dependencies likewise only depend on the number


-----

**Fig.** **7. Evolution** of the smartwatch SPL of Xiaomi Mi Band (versions 6‚Äì8).


of evolving features. This targeted focus ensures that the approach
remains manageable and effective in real-world scenarios as long as
the number of evolving features is reasonable.

**_RQ2:_** **_Does_** **_the_** **_approach_** **_scale_** **_to_** **_SPLs_** **_of_** **_realistic_** **_size?_**
We conclude that our approach is scalable regarding the size of
the SPL. Despite the fact that Scenario 3 requires to generate products
which is one of the most costly analysis operation in SPLs, in our
approach not all products are required to be generated. As explained
in Section 5.1, ‚Äò‚Äòwe generate a sample of products of a given size‚Äô‚Äô, and
thus, we can always consider a reasonable sample size that makes sense
to be manually analyzed and voted by the stakeholders.

_5.6._ _Threats_ _to_ _validity_

While using a real-world industrial example for validation offers
rich insights, it is imperative to acknowledge potential threats to validity inherent in this approach.


_Internal_ _validity: A_ potential threat to validity is the researcher bias
or subjective interpretation that may influence the results since the real
opinions of the Xiaomi stakeholders were not used. In our case, this is
not a problem, as the opinions used in the calculations in this paper are
simply there for illustration purposes. The scalability of the calculations
is not affected by the actual opinions. It could be possible, though, that
the number of Xiaomi stakeholders consulted is significantly higher (we
always used 3 stakeholder opinions in our illustrations). Again, this is
not problematic, as our calculation algorithm complexity scales linearly
with the number of opinions that need to be processed.

_External_ _validity: One_ such concern is the limited generalizability of
findings, as case studies often focus on specific contexts and may not
represent broader populations or circumstances. It is noteworthy that
our validation employs a real-world industrial example centered on the
Xiaomi SPL. This choice enhances the relevance and applicability of our
findings within a tangible industrial setting, offering valuable insights


-----

into practical challenges and solutions within the realm of software
development. In terms of applicability, as shown in our validation, our
approach does not need to consider all features of an SPL, but only
those that change during evolution. Even in real-world SPLs such as
the biggest known SPL reported (i.e., the Linux kernel with more than
18,000 features (She et al., 2010; Th√ºm, 2020)) the number of features
that change and need to be consider from one version to another
is not so high, especially when those features need to be manually
analyzed by humans. Thus, we believe that the Xiaomi SPL example
nicely showcases the applicability of our approach. A final threat is
the ecological validity due to possible errors in the calculations of the
experiment materials and tools used. To mitigate this threat we have
relied on well-known libraries for subjective logic (Bertoa et al., 2020;
Mu√±oz et al., 2020a) and tools for automated analysis of feature models
such as Flama (Galindo et al., 2023).

**6.** **Related** **work**

This section discusses the related work on uncertainty and decisionmaking in software engineering specifically in the context of software
product line engineering.

_6.1._ _Stakeholder_ _analysis_ _and_ _decision-making_

There exist several decision-making techniques and tools to make
the right decisions when stakeholders with different expertise are involved (Achimugu et al., 2014). Some of the more commonly used
techniques are the analytic _hierarchical_ _process (AHP)_ (Zhang et al.,
2014), the WinWin approach (Boehm and Kitapci, 2006), or the Kano
model (Kano, 1984), among many others (Achimugu et al., 2014;
Hudaib et al., 2018). These techniques are mainly employed as prioritization methods for requirements engineering. Before applying these
techniques, stakeholders need to analyze the most important business
factors, e.g., value, cost, risk, implementation effort, success, or urgency
for each requirement (or feature in the context of SPLs). However, getting the stakeholders‚Äô input for those factors is not straightforward due
to the existence of uncertainty, which is not considered in the classical
techniques for decision-making and stakeholder analysis (Achimugu
et al., 2014). Subjective logic is an alternative method that allows
ranking requirements or features‚Äô priority taking into account the uncertainty in the analysis of the stakeholder for the different business
factors.

**_Subjective_** **_logic_** **_in_** **_software_** **_engineering_** _. Subjective_ logic has been
applied in several domains, e.g., artificial intelligence (H√ºllermeier and
Waegeman, 2021), software engineering (Troya et al., 2021), or digital
humanities (Martin-Rodilla and Gonzalez-Perez, 2019). In the software
engineering domain Troya et al. (2021), subjective logic has been
mainly applied in the requirements engineering context for different
purposes (e.g., to check whether a product meets its specifications
in natural language (Sree-Kumar et al., 2018), or to specify architectures requirements with incomplete information (Bertoa et al., 2020),
among others). But subjective logic has also been applied to modelbased software engineering (MBSE) to deal with belief uncertainty in
domain models (Burgue√±o et al., 2022). Concretely, Bertoa et al. (2020)
applied subjective logic to software models (e.g., primitive dataypes
in UML/OCL models) to enrich them with individual opinions from
experts and reach agreements about the uncertainty of the values
obtained from physical measurements or user estimations. To the best
of our knowledge and according to the survey presented in Troya et al.
(2021), subjective logic has not been applied before to SPLs. However,
several works deal with uncertainty and probabilities in SPLs.


_6.2._ _Uncertainty_ _and_ _decision-making_ _in_ _SPLs_

Uncertainty and decision-making are present at different stages of
the SPL process, including requirements elicitation (Famelis et al.,
2017; Sree-Kumar et al., 2018; Sree-Kumar et al., 2021), product configuration (Czarnecki et al., 2008; Martinez et al., 2014; Mazo et al.,
2014; N√∂hrer and Egyed, 2013; Pereira et al., 2018; Rodas-Silva et al.,
2019), and automated analysis of feature models (Heradio et al., 2019;
Horcas et al., 2023). In fact, recently, Horcas et al. (2023) identify up to
ten SPL problems where uncertainty is present in the decision-making
process, including product configuration and reverse engineering of
feature models. They propose a simulation-based framework to apply
Monte Carlo methods which deal with the uncertainty of the large
configuration spaces of SPLs. However, only five of the ten identified problems are modeled and solved. The next release problem and
evolution of feature models are only mentioned.

**_SPL_** **_requirements_** **_and_** **_modeling_** _. Sree-Kumar_ et al. (2018), SreeKumar et al. (2021) proposed a method to check whether a feature
model meets the textual specifications of the SPL requirements. They
assign a confidence _score [0..1] to_ each feature and relationship in the
feature model that measures the likelihood that the textual requirements identify this element as relevant in the SPL. However, such
a confidence score is automatically assigned using natural language
processing (NLP) based on the correctness (choice of representative
elements) and completeness (no missing elements) of the feature model,
and thus, the values do not consider subjective opinions from relevant
stakeholders. Famelis et al. (2017) made a research vision about
combining variability abstractions with partial _modeling (Famelis_ et al.,
2012), a technique for managing design uncertainty within a software
model (Dhaouadi et al., 2021) that explicates decision points and
represents the set of possible models that could be obtained by making
decisions and solving uncertainty. In Almharat (2016), Almharat deals
with the lack of probabilistic quantification of model‚Äôs implications and
decision support for reasoning under uncertainty. The work proposes
(i) the construction of a Bayesian Belief Feature Model, capable of
quantifying the uncertainty measures in model parameters, and (2) a
mathematical reasoner for Uncertain Constraint Satisfaction Problems
to satisfy the model constraints by considering probability weight for
all involved parameters and quantify the actual implications of the
problem constraints.

**_SPL_** **_configuration. Product_** configuration is the SPL process where
decision-making techniques have been applied the most so far. The
concept of probabilistic _feature_ _models (Czarnecki_ et al., 2008) was
introduced to automate the choice propagation of features according to the constraints by applying an entropy _measure to_ guide the
configuration process. Also, Feature _relations_ _graphs_ _(FRoGs) (Martinez_
et al., 2014) show the impact of a given feature on all other features
using a confidence _metric that_ represents the probability of finding a
product that violates a constraint. Both works (Czarnecki et al., 2008;
Martinez et al., 2014) rely on historical data to extract probabilities
without taking into account opinions from domain experts. In fact,
historical data from previous users‚Äô configurations has been a wide
source of knowledge to feed recommendation systems and guide decisions in the next release problem. Rodas-Silva et al. (2019) propose
a recommender system for the selection of the best components set to
implement a given configuration of the SPL based on the users‚Äô rating
of such components. Mazo et al. (2014) proposed recommendation
heuristics to prioritize choices and recommend candidate features to be
configured. The purpose of their approach is to reduce the number of
configuration steps and optimize the computation time required by the
solver to propagate the configuration choices. N√∂hrer and Egyed (2013)
investigate the ordering of the decisions when configuring a product
to automatically optimize user guidance by reducing the number of
decisions that need answering. Pereira et al. (2018) proposed a featurebased personalized recommender system for product-line configuration


-----

that guides decision-makers in understanding users‚Äô needs and preferences. It focuses on decision-makers who lack sufficient personal
experience to evaluate the complex technical properties of the features.
The main drawback of these works (Mazo et al., 2014; N√∂hrer and
Egyed, 2013; Pereira et al., 2018; Rodas-Silva et al., 2019) is that
they do not take into account the expertise of the domain experts,
only the final users‚Äô rating (Rodas-Silva et al., 2019), users‚Äô needs
and preferences (Pereira et al., 2018), or historical data from previous
users‚Äô configurations (Mazo et al., 2014; N√∂hrer and Egyed, 2013) are
considered.

**_SPL_** **_evolution. Finally,_** in Sang Tran and Massacci (2014) the authors
propose an approach for decision support on the uncertainty in feature
model evolution. They assist the selection of an optimal configuration,
which is a set of features to be implemented, and define two evolution
models: Evolution _Possibility_ _Model (ePM)_ to describe potential possibilities a feature model could evolve, and Evolutionary _Feature_ _Model_
(eFM) to describe the feature model with all changes due to evolution
incorporated. They use two analysis techniques to facilitate the decision
support: Survivability _analysis that_ answers whether a configuration (i.e.,
set of features) could survive during the expected evolution, and repair
_cost_ _analysis that_ answers which configuration requires less effort to get
repaired due to changes. In Section 3, we have identified three evolution scenarios where subjective logic may improve the decision-making
process by explicitly considering and reasoning about the existing
uncertainty using SBoolean opinions.

**7.** **Conclusions** **and** **future** **work**

In this paper, we applied subjective logic to capture and address
uncertainty when making decisions for SPL evolution. In particular,
we described in detail three feature model evolution scenarios, and
explained how stakeholder opinions can be quantified for decisionmaking in these scenarios using a real-world industrial example. Our
approach considers feature dependencies and supports different decision strategies (e.g., risky vs. conservative) through the use of different
fusion operators and different decision thresholds when making the final decision. Finally, we proposed two Likert-type scales ‚Äì one carrying
uncertainty and one without ‚Äì with easy-to-understand textual literals
to simplify voting using subjective logic for non-expert stakeholder.

We open a new window of research where belief uncertainty could
become a new tool of great value in the SPL practitioner‚Äôs toolkit
whenever the opinions of different stakeholders have to be taken into
account to make informed decisions.

As part of our future work, we plan to apply our approach to other
real SPLs to study more thoroughly the impact of the size of the SPL
on the performance and scalability of our approach. We would also
like to perform empirical studies with users as stakeholders providing
opinions in a real setting. This would allow us to study the usefulness
and usability of our approach. Last, but not least, we would also like
to integrate our approach into other tools such as FeatureIDE (Th√ºm
et al., 2014) to make it available to a wider range of users.
